Update : SoftUni denied my request to share their materials here. Copyright issues. Since than I've taken down all resources under their copyright from this site.

This is a new beginning for me. Today I've decided to start sharing everything about the process of going through Software University's Software Engineering program. 

My first self proclaimed task is to collect and upload all the lecture slides and related materials in an easy to access pdf format instead of the Word and PowerPoint documents in which they reside now. 

Hopefully they will be of use to not only me, but my fellow students.

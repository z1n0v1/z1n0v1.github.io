Finished !  
<br>
All my code backlog is pushed to GitHub :)  
<br>
Fist was the [repository](https://github.com/z1n0v1/M01-Java-Fundamentals) containing solutions of the problems part of the Java [Fundamentals](/M01-Java-Fundamentals/) course. It contains 261 files and 7756 lines of Java code (without the comments).
<br>
<br>
Then came the [Java Advanced](/M02-Java-Advanced/) - [repository](https://github.com/z1n0v1/M02-Java-Advanced) - 202 files, 6489 lines of code.
<br>
<br>
[Java OOP](/M02-Java-OOP/) - [repository](https://github.com/z1n0v1/M02-Java-OOP) - 334 files, 5753 lines of code.
<br>
<br>
[MySQL](/M03-MySQL/) - [repository](https://github.com/z1n0v1/M03-MySQL) - 176 files, 11318 lines of code.
<br>
<br>
All in all we are talking about 797 files and 19998 lines of highly algorithmic java code (maybe I should add 2 more lines somewhere and round them to 20k LOC.
<br>
<br>
In contrast the 11318 lines of SQL code aren't so impressive. There is some duplication because I've split the solutions in a file per problem. Nevertheless it was an interesting work.
<br>
<br>
Only 4.42 files and 111.1 Java LOC per day (what is with these numbers !?) for the last 6 months. It shows my work for the period.
<br>
<br>
If we add the SQL we are talking about  5.41 files and 174 LOC per day.
<br>
<br>
Next comes the interesting part. I plan to push the solutions as I solve the problems of [Spring Data](/M03-Spring-Data/) course. Expect more lines of code (it's time for some boilerplate). We'll start counting the [repository](https://github.com/z1n0v1/M03-Spring-Data)'s commit count.
<br>
<br>
So far it has been fun. There is a lot that one can take from the courses if one focuses on work instead grades (they come anyway).
<br>
<br>
Clean code to everyone !
<br>
